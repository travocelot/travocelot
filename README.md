I am a community college student learning how to program. I also work full time in a non-tech role in a tech-adjacent industry.
I have taken courses on Python, C++, and MySQL. I am currently taking prerequisite math courses to continue my CS studies.

I am looking to learn more about programming and develop my skills further. In summer 2025 I will be taking a class on Java.

Fun fact: I speak 3 languages (EN/FR/ES)
